This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: the lack of proper error handling for POST requests.  The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code, where no checks are made for empty or invalid request bodies. This can lead to unexpected behavior, crashes, or vulnerabilities. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with comprehensive error handling to address these issues, ensuring the server responds gracefully to various input scenarios.  This example highlights the importance of robust error handling in building secure and reliable Express.js applications.
